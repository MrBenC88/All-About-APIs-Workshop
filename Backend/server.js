/**
 * This is our actual server file. This server is where we connect the MongoDB database and define the routes that we would use.
 *
 * Setup required frameworks.
 * We will be building an Express Web Application using Node.js
 *
 * We wil require the following:
 * express: node.js web app framework
 * cors: middleware for Express
 * mongoose: used for MongoDB and helps connect to mongodb database
 * dotenv: allows you to separate secrets from your source code - important for .ENV file.
 *
 * To run the server, first we need to install the dependencies. In step 1, you must (in your command terminal) navigate into the backend folder. (cd backend)
 * Next, with npm install you can easily install all the dependencies required as we have written a script in the package.json to help simplify this process.
 * Finally, to run the server, simply type nodemon server in the backend folder.
 *
 * How to run the server:
 * 1. cd backend
 * 2. npm install
 * 3. nodemon server
 *  */

/** How to start?
 *
 *  Initial Express Server Setup.
 * 1. Dependencies
 * 2. Set up express function (app and port)
 * 3. Set up middleware and use express.json method
 *    Pass in our defined port variable so our server can accept a parameter from the environment and what port to listen to.  (app.listen)
 *    Confirm server is running.
 *    Run server to confirm.
 *
 * 4. (TODO #1): Create .env file for MongoDB credentials
 * 5. (TODO #2): Variable to store the info in the .env var. -> const uri = process.env.ATLAS_URI
 * 6. (TODO #3): Connect to MongoDB Database
 * 7. Set a variable so we can check that we are connected to the database  -> const connection = mongoose.connection;
 * 8. (TODO #4): Confirm the connection and output a success message if connected successfully via a function.
 * 9. Define our user route -> const userRouter = require("./routes/users");
 * 10. (TODO #5) Mount the middleware for the routes served by the userRouter -> app.use("/users", userRouter);
 */
